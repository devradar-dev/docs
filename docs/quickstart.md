# Quick Start

Get up and running with DevRadar in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A Google account (for authentication)
- A modern web browser

## Step 1: Sign In

1. Visit [devradar.dev](https://devradar.dev)
2. Click **Sign In** in the top right
3. Authenticate with your Google account

That's it - no additional setup required!

## Step 2: Your First Compatibility Check

The quickest way to understand DevRadar is to try a compatibility check:

1. Navigate to the **Check** page from the navigation
2. Enter your first technology (e.g., `nextjs`)
3. Enter your second technology (e.g., `prisma`)
4. Click **Check Compatibility**

You'll see an instant result with:
- **Compatibility Status** - Compatible, Partial, Incompatible, Deprecated, or Unknown
- **Severity Level** - Info, Warning, Error, or Critical
- **Detailed Message** - What works, what doesn't, and why
- **Workarounds** - Alternative approaches when available

## Step 3: Explore the AI Tools Directory

Discover AI coding tools that work with your stack:

1. Navigate to **Tools** from the navigation
2. Use filters to narrow down by:
   - Tool type (AI IDE, CLI Agent, Vibe Coding, Managed Platform)
   - Capabilities (SSR, Mobile, Database support, etc.)
   - Privacy model
3. Click any tool to see detailed comparisons

## Step 4: Build Your Stack (Optional)

For a more comprehensive approach, use the Stack Wizard:

1. Click **New Project** on your dashboard
2. Choose your development approach:
   - **Track A**: AI-Assisted Development (select an AI tool first)
   - **Track B**: Traditional Development (start with your framework)
3. Follow the 5-step guided process
4. Get a compatibility score for your complete stack

## Common Use Cases

### "I'm starting a new project"
Use the **Stack Wizard** to build and validate your complete tech stack.

### "I want to check if X works with Y"
Use the **Compatibility Checker** for instant pair verification.

### "I'm evaluating AI coding tools"
Browse the **AI Tools Directory** and compare capabilities side-by-side.

### "I want to check my existing project"
Upload your `package.json` to the **Project Scanner** for analysis.
