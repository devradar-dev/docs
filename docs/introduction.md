# Introduction

**DevRadar** is your pre-flight check system for modern software development. Before you commit to a tech stack, verify that all your chosen technologies work together seamlessly.

## The Problem

Developers face a complex landscape of technology choices:

- **50+ AI coding tools** claiming to be "the best" - but which actually work for your stack?
- **1000+ technology combinations** - some compatible, some problematic
- **Hidden integration issues** that surface late in development
- **Outdated information** across scattered documentation

Making the wrong choice costs weeks of rework.

## The Solution

DevRadar provides **real-time compatibility verification** for your technology stack:

- **Instant Compatibility Checks** - Verify any technology pair in milliseconds
- **AI Tools Directory** - Compare 50+ AI coding tools with detailed capability matrices
- **Smart Wizard** - Guided tech stack selection with real-time feedback
- **Project Scanning** - Upload your `package.json` to identify potential issues
- **Content Hub** - In-depth guides, reviews, comparisons, and insights

## Who Is This For?

### Solo Developers
Validate your tech choices before investing time in implementation.

### Startups
Move faster with confidence that your stack components work together.

### Engineering Teams
Standardize technology evaluation across your organization.

### DevRel & Technical Writers
