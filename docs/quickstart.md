# Quick Start

Get up and running with DevRadar in under 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A Google account (for saving projects)
- A modern web browser

## Step 1: Check Technology Compatibility

The quickest way to understand DevRadar is to try a compatibility check:

1. Visit [devradar.dev](https://devradar.dev)
2. Navigate to the **Check** page from the navigation
3. Enter your first technology (e.g., `nextjs`)
4. Enter your second technology (e.g., `prisma`)
5. Click **Check Compatibility**

You'll see an instant result with:
- **Compatibility Status** - Compatible, Partial, Incompatible, Deprecated, or Unknown
- **Severity Level** - Info, Warning, Error, or Critical
- **Detailed Message** - What works, what doesn't, and why
- **Workarounds** - Alternative approaches when available

## Step 2: Scan Your Project

Already have a project? Check your entire tech stack at once:

1. Navigate to the **Scan** page at [devradar.dev/scan](https://devradar.dev/scan)
2. Upload your `package.json` file
3. View automatic compatibility analysis

The scanner detects:
- All dependencies in your project
- Potential compatibility issues
- Edge Runtime conflicts
- Database pairing problems

## Step 3: Explore AI Tools Directory

Discover AI coding tools that work with your stack:

1. Navigate to **Tools** from the navigation
2. Use filters to narrow down by:
   - Tool type (AI IDE, CLI Agent, Vibe Coding, Managed Platform)
   - Capabilities (SSR, Mobile, Database support, etc.)
   - Privacy model
3. Click any tool to see detailed comparisons

## Step 4: Build Your Stack with the Wizard

For a comprehensive approach, use the Stack Wizard to build and validate your complete stack:

1. Navigate to [/wizard](https://devradar.dev/wizard) (sign in required)
2. Choose your development approach:
   - **Track A**: AI-Assisted Development (select an AI tool first)
   - **Track B**: Traditional Development (start with your framework)
3. Follow the 5-step guided process
4. Get a compatibility score for your complete stack
5. Save your project to track changes over time

## Common Use Cases

### "I'm starting a new project"
Use the **Stack Wizard** at [/wizard](https://devradar.dev/wizard) to build and validate your complete tech stack.

### "I want to check if X works with Y"
Use the **Compatibility Checker** at [/check](https://devradar.dev/check) for instant pair verification.

### "I'm evaluating AI coding tools"
Browse the **AI Tools Directory** at [/tools](https://devradar.dev/tools) and compare capabilities side-by-side.

### "I want to check my existing project"
Upload your `package.json` to the **Stack Scanner** at [/scan](https://devradar.dev/scan) for analysis.
